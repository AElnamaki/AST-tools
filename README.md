# AST TOOLS üèó

Python Code Analysis Tools for the dci_fbw_p23_e07 Class

## üß∞ Tool Repository

Welcome to The DCI toolbox! This toolbox is an essential part of our Python projects.

### üöÄ Installation

Get started in no time! Follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/AElnamaki/AST-tools.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the AST-tools Directory**:

    ```bash
    $ cd AST-tools
    ```

3. **Make the Install Script Executable**:

    ```bash
    $ sudo chmod +x install.sh
    ```

4. **Run the Install Script**:

    ```bash
    $ bash ./install.sh
    ```

### üí° Usage

After executing the script, it will prompt you to provide the path to your Python code. Once you insert the path of your Python file, the script will generate a graph representing all the operations in your code based on the abstract syntax tree. The generated graph will be stored in the same directory as the script.

For instance, to generate an AST graph from a Python file, run:

```bash
$ python3 Python_graph.py YOUR/PATH/TO/YOUR/PYTHON/FILE
